    <!-- 2. Design & Architecture -->
    <section id="architecture">
        <h2>2. Design & Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            SpendWise follows an <strong>MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)</strong> architecture to keep the
            UI and business logic clearly separated. The app uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ViewModel + LiveData</strong> for reactive UI updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Repository pattern</strong> to abstract data sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Firestore / Room</strong> for persistent storage.</li>
            <li><strong>SharedPreferences</strong> to cache theme and user preferences locally.</li>
            <li><strong>RecyclerView</strong> for lists like expenses and budgets.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- MVVM Architecture Section -->
        <h3>2.1 MVVM Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern is the foundation of SpendWise's 
            codebase. This architectural approach provides clear separation of concerns and makes 
            our application more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
        </p>
        <h4>Components of MVVM:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Represents the data and business logic. In SpendWise, models 
                include entities like Expense, Budget, SavingsCircle, and User. These classes encapsulate 
                data structures and contain validation logic.</li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong> The UI layer (Activities and Fragments) that displays data to 
                users and handles user interactions. Views observe ViewModels and update automatically 
                when data changes.</li>
            <li><strong>ViewModel:</strong> Acts as a bridge between the View and Model. ViewModels hold 
                UI-related data that survives configuration changes (like screen rotations) and expose 
                LiveData objects that Views can observe. They contain no direct references to Views, 
                making them easily testable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Benefits of MVVM in SpendWise:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Business logic is separated from UI code, 
                making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>Testability:</strong> ViewModels can be unit tested independently without 
                Android framework dependencies, allowing for faster and more reliable tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle Awareness:</strong> ViewModels survive configuration changes, 
                preventing data loss when users rotate their devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Reactive Updates:</strong> LiveData provides observable data holders that 
                automatically update the UI when data changes, reducing boilerplate code.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> Multiple Views can observe the same ViewModel, 
                ensuring consistent data across different screens.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Throughout the SpendWise application, each major feature (Expenses, Budgets, Savings Circles, 
            Chatbot) follows this pattern, with dedicated ViewModels managing the state and business 
            logic for their respective features.
        </p>

        <!-- Checkstyle Section -->
        <h3>2.2 Code Quality with Checkstyle</h3>
        <p>
            To maintain high code quality and consistency across the entire codebase, SpendWise 
            integrates Checkstyle, an automated code style checking tool. Checkstyle enforces 
            coding standards and best practices automatically during the build process.
        </p>
        <h4>Checkstyle Configuration:</h4>
        <p>
            Our Checkstyle configuration enforces several important rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maximum Line Length:</strong> 100 characters per line to ensure code readability 
                and compatibility with various screen sizes and code review tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Method Length:</strong> 150 lines per method to prevent overly complex 
                methods and encourage proper code decomposition.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Parameters:</strong> 7 parameters per method to maintain clean method 
                signatures and encourage the use of parameter objects when needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Javadoc Requirements:</strong> All public classes, methods, and fields must have 
                comprehensive Javadoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and 
                exceptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Naming Conventions:</strong> Enforces Java naming conventions for classes, methods, 
                variables, and constants.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Structure:</strong> Validates proper indentation, brace placement, and 
                whitespace usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures all team members follow the same coding standards, 
                making the codebase easier to read and maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Catches style violations during development, preventing 
                code quality issues from accumulating.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Enforcement:</strong> Removes the need for manual code review of style 
                issues, allowing reviewers to focus on logic and architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Javadoc requirements ensure that code is well-documented, 
                making it easier for new team members to understand the codebase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Checkstyle runs automatically as part of our Gradle build process, ensuring that no code 
            with style violations can be merged into the main branch. This automated enforcement has 
            been crucial in maintaining code quality throughout the project's development lifecycle.

        </div>

        <!-- Dark Mode Section -->
        <h3>3.1 Dark Mode</h3>
        <p>
            SpendWise features comprehensive dark mode support, allowing users to switch between 
            light and dark themes seamlessly throughout the entire application. This feature 
            enhances user experience by providing better readability in low-light conditions and 
            reducing eye strain during extended use.
        </p>
        <h4>Implementation Details:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme Toggle:</strong> A single toggle switch in the settings allows users 
                to instantly switch between light and dark modes. The preference is saved using 
                SharedPreferences, ensuring the user's choice persists across app sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>System-Wide Application:</strong> When dark mode is enabled, all screens, 
                including Dashboard, Expense Log, Budgets, Savings Circles, Chatbot, and Profile, 
                automatically adapt to the dark theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Color Scheme:</strong> The dark mode uses carefully selected 
                color palettes that maintain contrast ratios for accessibility while providing a 
                comfortable viewing experience. All UI components, including buttons, cards, text, 
                and charts, are styled appropriately for both themes.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Theme changes are applied immediately without 
                requiring an app restart. The ViewModel architecture ensures that all active 
                fragments and activities update their UI components reactively when the theme 
                preference changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Storage:</strong> The user's theme preference is stored locally 
                using SharedPreferences and synchronized with Firebase for multi-device consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Benefits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced eye strain in low-light environments</li>
            <li>Improved battery life on devices with OLED displays</li>
            <li>Personal preference accommodation for user comfort</li>
            <li>Consistent visual experience across all app features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The dark mode implementation follows Material Design guidelines, ensuring that the 
            application maintains a professional and modern appearance in both light and dark 
            themes while providing optimal usability.
        </p>

        <!-- Unit Tests Section -->
        <h3>4.1 Unit Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Comprehensive unit testing is a critical component of SpendWise's development process, 
            ensuring code reliability, preventing regressions, and maintaining high code quality 
            throughout the application lifecycle.
        </p>
        <h4>Testing Strategy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Logic Testing:</strong> All ViewModels and business logic classes 
                are thoroughly unit tested. These tests verify that calculations, data transformations, 
                and business rules work correctly independently of the Android framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Repository Testing:</strong> Data repository classes are tested to ensure 
                proper data retrieval, storage, and synchronization with Firebase Firestore. Mock 
                objects are used to simulate Firebase responses, allowing tests to run quickly and 
                reliably.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Validation:</strong> Model classes (Expense, Budget, SavingsCircle, etc.) 
                are tested to ensure data validation, constraint checking, and proper data structure 
                initialization.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility Function Testing:</strong> Helper classes and utility functions, 
                such as date formatters, currency converters, and calculation helpers, are covered 
                by unit tests to ensure accuracy and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Testing Tools and Frameworks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JUnit:</strong> The primary testing framework used for writing and executing 
                unit tests. JUnit provides annotations and assertions that make test writing 
                straightforward and readable.</li>
            <li><strong>Mockito:</strong> Used for creating mock objects and stubbing method calls. 
                Mockito allows us to isolate units under test by replacing dependencies with mock 
                implementations, ensuring tests focus on specific functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Robolectric:</strong> Enables running Android-dependent tests on the JVM 
                without requiring an emulator or physical device, significantly speeding up test 
                execution times.</li>
            <li><strong>AndroidX Test:</strong> Provides additional testing utilities for Android 
                components, including LiveData testing helpers and lifecycle-aware testing tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Test Coverage:</h4>
        <p>
            Our unit tests cover critical business logic including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expense calculation and aggregation</li>
            <li>Budget tracking and threshold warnings</li>

            <li>ViewModel state management</li>
            <li>Repository data operations</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Bug Detection:</strong> Unit tests catch bugs during development, 
                before they reach production, reducing debugging time and improving code quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Refactoring Confidence:</strong> Comprehensive test coverage provides 
                confidence when refactoring code, ensuring that changes don't break existing 
                functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Well-written unit tests serve as executable 
                documentation, showing how classes and methods are intended to be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Regression Prevention:</strong> Tests prevent previously fixed bugs from 
                reoccurring when new code is added or modified.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unit tests are integrated into our continuous integration pipeline, running automatically 
            on every commit and pull request. This ensures that all code changes are validated 
            before being merged into the main branch, maintaining the stability and reliability 
            of the SpendWise application.

        <h2>5. Conclusions, Reflections, and Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Building SpendWise gave our team hands-on experience with Android development,
            Git-based collaboration, and clean architecture patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the key challenges we faced included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing state across multiple fragments while keeping the UI responsive.</li>
            <li>Ensuring theme changes (Light/Dark Mode) propagate instantly across screens.</li>
            <li>Designing a database schema that works well with both budgets and expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Through this project, we learned:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to apply MVVM with ViewModel and LiveData in a real app.</li>
            <li>How to integrate Firebase/Room and SharedPreferences effectively.</li>
            <li>How to design consistent UI/UX with reusable components and themes.</li>
        </ul>
